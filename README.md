Lion Express Database Management System

Database for the Lion Express and all its facets. 
The Lion Express is a free student run shuttle service where all students can explore the surrounding LMU area.
Destinations include Playa Vista, LAX, and the Westfield mall.

We will be using PostgreSQL as our DBMS. The database will be maintained on Github and we will develop a separate interface for users to interact with the database system.
